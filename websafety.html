            <h3>Web Safety</h3>
            <p>
                Web safety, also known as online safety or internet safety, refers to the safe and responsible use of the internet and technology. It involves being aware of potential risks and taking steps to protect yourself and others from online threats, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and exposure to inappropriate content.

                Web safety is important because the internet has become an integral part of our daily lives, and we rely on it for communication, information, entertainment, and commerce. However, the internet can also be a dangerous place, especially for children and vulnerable populations, and it is important to take steps to ensure that our online experiences are safe and secure. <br><br>
